where you put something on your webpage matters - scripts, css, html, objects, etc.
HTML doesn't know the id exists

Script in the body - fetches and executes

async - parsing and loading at the same time, waits to execute the script
defer - waits until the whole page is loaded then executes the script

Place references to libraries at the top of the webpage

"let" declares a variable that exists only inside the script

API is raw code that's accessed upon the wedpage loading
map object is created with the function
console allows you to grab things, change them (ex. change the zoome of the map), see what's in it
